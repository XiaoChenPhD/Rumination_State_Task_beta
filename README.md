# Rumination_State_Task_beta_
This experiment is to use psychopy to redo the rumination state task (RST).
 
RST consists of 4 conditions: resting state, sad autobiographical memory, rumination, 
and distraction.
 
The major rationale of the RST is to induce the participants into a self-constrained, 
continuous active rumination state.

The resting state is the baseline.

The sad autobiographical memory condition is for mood induction so that participants can 
ruminate more smoothly. The keywords were generated by the participants themselves before 
the MRI.

The rumination condition is of major interest.

The distraction condition serves as the control condition.

It is recommended that participants are briefed on the protocol and purpose of RST before 
undergo the actual scan.
